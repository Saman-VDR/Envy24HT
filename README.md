<h3>Install driver:</h3>

Open Terminal, change directory to the one where you unpacked the zip and type sudo bash install.sh
Actually worked without a restart.

<h3>Removing driver:</h3>

If you want to remove the driver, you have to unload the kext (twice) and remove the directory where the kext is located. Open the terminal and type (copy/paste from here) the following:

sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/Envy24HTPCIAudioDriver.kext > /dev/null
sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/Envy24HTPCIAudioDriver.kext > /dev/null
sudo rm -R /System/Library/Extensions/Envy24HTPCIAudioDriver.kext
